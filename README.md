# Little Angular Book

Helpful notes for taming the kraken called Angular.

## Book deprecation warning

I wrote these notes for Angular 5 in 2018 Q1, they may or may not be totally
outdated. I don't know - if I have to work with Angular again, I might
update this book. Or might not.

## Toolchain deprecation warning

Created with `gitbook-cli` (GitBook 3.2.3): since GitBook has deprecated the old gitbook-cli
way of publishing git books, please browse this project [locally](./docs/SUMMARY.md)
(the original exported gitbook may [still work though](https://szkrd.gitbooks.io/little-angular-book/content/)).
