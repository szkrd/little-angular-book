# Problems

Problems I couldn't find a satisfactory answer.

- Global styles. Deep selectors are gone from the spec, imports are duplicated.
- Directive's style "falls out" from the current host element.
- 3rd party decorators in production build. Not supported in A5 ([ticket](https://github.com/ngParty/ng-metadata/issues/217)).
- There's no template <--> class level visibility, public is the only option.
- `Can't resolve all parameters for ... This will become an error in Angular v6.x` [known bug](https://github.com/angular/angularfire2/issues/1206)
